# Game Animation

`Note`: I've forked this repository from `https://github.com/samirak93/Game-Animation`. The code is not written by me. I just made some small changes to make it easier to use:
- I've cleaned up unneccesary folders like `__pycache__` and `.ipynb_checkpoints`.
- I've added a `.gitignore` file to keep the repository clean.
- I've added an `environment.yml` file such that you can install all necessary requirements to run the notebooks.
- I've changed the calculation of the convex hull of teams to not inlcude the goalkeeper.  
  
  
An easy way to visualize player tracking data with animation. Built using [Bokeh Plots](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh), this tool can be used to visualise player movements for all sport. It also includes visualising voronoi and convex hulls, player speed and total distance covered by each player, interactively.

## Installation
The interactive plots are provided in jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to get started is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). 
After installing Anaconda, follow these steps.

Download the repository by clicking the download button on the top right or running the following command in the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/seidlr/Game-Animation.git
```
Then change into the new directory
```
cd Game-Animation
```
and install all necessary dependencies into a fresh conda environment by running
```
conda env update
```
This will create a new environment callled `game-animation`. Activate it by running
```
conda activate game-animation
```
Now you are ready to run the jupyter notebook server.
```
jupyter notebook
```


## New Features: 
Visualize players being marked by opposition players and find the distance between them. Statistics such as `total time player was marked`, `average distance between the players` can also be calculated and visualised.

The code was tested on **`Python 3.7.1`**, but should work for other versions as well. 

The following packages are needed in order to run the code (*Bokeh plot version has to be 1.2.0 but for other packages with older versions, the tool should work*) :

| Package |Version|
|--|--|
| Numpy |1.16.4|
|Pandas|0.24.2|
| Bokeh|1.2.0|
| Scipy|1.3.0|
| Notebook|5.7.8|


The animation plot can be viewed directly on a `Jupyter Notebook`. 

### Usage
--- 
- 3 sample notebook examples ([Soccer_example.ipynb](Soccer_example.ipynb), [Basketball_example.ipynb](Basketball_example.ipynb) and [NFL_example.ipynb](NFL_example.ipynb)) are placed in the folder. 

- The background pitch images are placed in `/static/images/` folder.
